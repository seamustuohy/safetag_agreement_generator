{% block indem_and_liability %}

## Is the Assessor responsible if we suffer an attack in the future?

The Recipient understands that digital security is a continually growing and changing field and that security guidance provided by the Assessor does not mean that the Recipient will be able to secure their software from every form of attack.

There is no such thing as 100% security, and for example it is never possible to identify vulnerabilities in software or systems for threats that are not known at the time of the assessment.

The Assessor shall be under no liability whatever to the Recipient for any indirect loss and/or expense (including loss of profit) suffered by the Recipient arising out of their security.

{% for item in engagement.activities %}
* {{ item.name }}
{%- endfor %}
* Additionally, the {{ parties.assessor.designated_contact }} will hold meetings with the {{ parties.recipient.designated_contact }} , {{ engagement.update_meeting_frequency }}, to inform them of the overall progress of the assessment.

The extent to which assessment activities will be suspended, and the degree to which incidents must be addressed for activities to continue will be decided per-incident based upon an agreement by both parties.

The extent to which assessment activities should be suspended will vary based on the the type of incident, but in many cases the only activities suspended are those involving the systems directly involved in the incident.

## Emergency Contacts

The Parties ability to be able to get in touch in an emergency is vital. Emergencies may arise, and each Party must have an established point of contact in order to handle them. Each Party will designate one or more emergency contacts. Each party will give a list containing the following information about each of those contacts to the other party.

## Assessor Role in Addressing Incidents

When a security incident has been identified the Parties will come to an agreement as to whether the incident should be addressed immediately, or should be addressed after the Engagement.

{% if incident_response.assessor_mitigate_incident == true %}

If the Parties decide that the security incident should be addressed immediately the Assessor will mitigate, to the extent practicable, the harmful effects of the security incident that are known to the Assessor; and document security incidents and their outcomes.

{% elif incident_response.assessor_refer_incident == true %}

If the Parties decide that the security incident should be addressed immediately the Assessor will work with the Recipient to identify and contact an appropriate third-party who can mitigate, to the extent practicable, the harmful effects of the security incident that are known to the Assessor; and document security incidents and their outcomes. At this point the Parties will determine the extent to which the Assessor should continue assessment activities.
